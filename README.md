# Fairytales of Rihn

Fairytales of Rihn is an RPG set in the fantasy world of Rihn. The goal of this project is to create a balance of realism and engaging gameplay. To achieve that, we will be using real-world accounts from classical and medieval eras. The majority of races in the world of Rihn are based on real cultures with added flavor of fantasy.

Inspirations taken from such games as World of Warcraft and The Elder Scrolls series.
